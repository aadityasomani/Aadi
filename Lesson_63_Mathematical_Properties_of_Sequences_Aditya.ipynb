        "\n",
        "Fibonacci sequence is a very interesting ordered arrangement of numbers where the terms are found by adding the two previous terms. \n",
        "\n",
        "It looks like this:  **0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...**\n",
        "\n",
        "  The first two terms are 0 and 1. All other terms are obtained by adding two preceding terms. This means to say the $n^{th}$ term is the sum of $(n-1)^{th}$ and $(n-2)^{th}$ term.\n",
        "\n",
        "**For example:** \n",
        "\n",
        "- The third term `1` is obtained by adding the first term `0` and the second term `1`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Similarly, the fifth term `3` is obtained by adding the third term `1` and the fourth term `2`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The sum of first 5 terms would be: `0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7`\n",
        "\n",
        "Let us calculate the $n^{th}$ term in a Fibonacci sequence and also calculate the sum of the first $n$-terms using the steps given below in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Create the following two variables which signify the first two numbers of the sequence:\n",
        "    - `first_num = 0`\n",
        "    - `second_num = 1`\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Create a variable `fibonacci_sum` to store the sum of the first $n$-terms and initialize it with `1`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Ask the user to enter the term they would like to find and store it in a variable `n`. Convert it into integer using `int()` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Create a condition such that, if `n==1`, then print `\"The number in position 1 is: 0\"`, as the Fibonacci sequence always starts with `0`.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Else start a `for` loop which ranges from `2` to `n`. Inside this `for` loop:\n",
        " - Create a variable `temp` which  holds the sum of the preceding two terms.\n",
        " - Assign the value of `second_num` to `first_num` and `temp` to `second_num` to change the values of the preceding two terms for the next iteration.\n",
        " - Add the value of `second_num` to `fibonacci_sum` in each iteration as follows: \n",
        "   `fibonacci_sum = fibonacci_sum + second_num`.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Outside for loop, print the $n^{th}$ term in the following way:\n",
        "\n",
        "  `\"The number in position\", n ,\"is:\", second_num`, where `second_num` holds the $n^{th}$ term.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Print the sum of the first $n$-terms of the Fibonacci series by printing the value of the variable `fibonacci_sum`."
